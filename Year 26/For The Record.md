# For the Record

**Tracking my positions on various matters.**

## 1. Atheism

* There is insufficient evidence to support the claim that god(s) exist(s). I would technically be an agnostic, but that term would cover nearly everybody, or at the very least a segment of the population so large as to warrant further categorization. For all practical purposes, I am an atheist.
* The word 'atheist' makes me ambivalent. There is no necessity for a term to describe 'non-mathematician' or 'non-flat-earther.' That theism is a default position is rather irksome.

## 2. Group Identity

* 'Tribalism' is often employed to disparage nationalism, patriotism, or different kinds of preferential treatment we bestow upon our in-group. The rationale presented is this: We should expand our group identity to include a wider range of people, even the entire population on earth. This is a guilt-stirring tactic; its purpose is to shame us so we don't oppose when we're taken advantage of.
* Do not miss out the fact that our&mdash;let's say&mdash;tribal proclivities are going nowhere, and for good evolutionary reasons.  Do not expect to compel people to give up their identity and associate with those far away physically and culturally, and simultaneously expect this arrangement to be stable. 
* Advocates of globalism who insist that nationalism is a threat should also recognize that globalism is unsustainable without nationalism. A group can expand in a stable way only if its subsets are stable. In this case, if a disturbance occurs, the group can backtrack to the next largest subset. A group that expands by disregarding the needs of its subsets, on the other hand, risks a more damaging disintegration if a disturbance of significance takes place. 

## 3. Transparency

* Transparency beyond a certain point promotes mediocrity. This is particularly true in matters of scholarship. One must keep his work-in-progress private in order to protect it from low-quality feedback, and release it when it is appropriate to do so.
* Transparency increases the cost of mistakes, stifling creativity and encouraging groupthink.

## 4. Feminism

* Feminism: all rights, no responsibility.
* *Men + Women v Nature* far better describes the human condition than *Men v Women*. Both sexes have to contribute, each faces his or her own set of challenges, and in the long term neither wins unless the other wins too. Furthermore, women's welfare cannot be achieved without a certain prerequisite amount of men's welfare, for men must provide for their families, and women's welfare is a downstream effect of this provision. 
* Note that in societies in which women face widespread oppression, men don't exactly lead enviable lives. Both could use some improvement.

## 5. Pronouns

* I used the singular 'they' instead of 'he' or 'he or she' long before it became popular. 
* If using 'he' is sexist, so is using 'she.' If using 'he or she' makes someone say someone hasn't been counted, I say he has been counted twice. To those who advocate the expression 'women and men' I ask if they ever had a problem with 'ladies and gentlemen.' And while on this matter, I also ask if describing earth, nature, or countries as feminine is sexist too.
* Language reformers do not seek equality, they seek power. They lost me when they politicized pronouns. I don't use 'she' to mean 'he or she'. I don't subscribe to the nonsense of keeping track of how many 'he's and 'she's I've used. I don't use 'they' in a singular form.

## 6. Deadnaming

* Here's a [top-notch contender for Oppression Olympics](https://lifehacker.com/what-is-deadnaming-and-how-to-avoid-it-1845802589?utm_source=pocket-newtab-intl-en). Fake professor of fake studies&mdash;we are but normal people; spare us!

## 7. Human Nature

* Humans are good. Also, they are corruptible.

## 8. Conservatism

* Change is inevitable. Rapid change is dangerous. 
* One of the objectives of conservatism is to slow change down so man has the opportunity to detect consequences unforeseen and adapt accordingly.

## 9. US Politics

* The Democrats engaged in massive election fraud in the 2020 US Presidential Election. If legal votes are counted, Donald Trump wins. 

## 10. 9/11

* The events of September 11, 2001 need to be investigated properly. The official narrative, as presented by NIST, is unscientific and politically motivated. 
* The collapses of the three World Trade Center towers (including Building 7, into which no airplane did fly) were acts of controlled detonation. Building 7 provides the strongest evidence in favor of this assertion.

## 11. The Slow Watch 

* I think I have found the watch of a lifetime. It's the Slow Mo 02. I bought it in mid 2018 after lusting after it for three years. Then I kept it tucked away for two more years. One battery change and a band shortening later, I am wearing it daily.

* Love everything about it. This wait has made me truly appreciate how beautiful the watch is. I like square cases, but not square dials. I like round dials, but not round cases. This round dial in an octagonal case brings me the combination I want plus more.

* Here are the details. The 100 m water resistance aspect is great to know, but I'm never going to test it. The battery did not last me 45 months (lasted around 24 months). Not sure if that's cause for concern.

* I also like the clean design of Slow Mo. Slow Jo gets too busy for me. 

* Mo looks like a normal watch on first glance, but you see it has one hand, and then you see the markings are not what they should be, and you realize there's something to inspect. 

* Also, no brand logo on the front. Perfection.

## 12. Midrange

* Midrange is for losers. Go ridiculously expensive&mdash;pay big to reduce variance; or go dirt cheap&mdash;accept high variance to reduce price. Avoid the temptation of the promise to get the best of both worlds; information asymmetry favors sellers: you will get the worst bits of both&mdash;too high a variance for too high a price.

## 13.  For you...

* Don't say to your child "I gave up \<my dream> for you." That's blaming your child for your failure.
* You might mean to say your child is more special than that dream. Or that you are sincerely dedicated to his well being, that you have worked very hard to afford him what he has. But that won't be communicated. Instead what will be communicated is that your child is to blame for your shattered dreams. 
* Taking care of your child and succeeding at your dream&mdash;that's your job. Not either one, but both. 
* And what the hell would you be communicating? That your child should give up his dreams too? That he should be your slave because you sacrificed for him?
* Achieve your dreams. Set the right example for your child to follow.
