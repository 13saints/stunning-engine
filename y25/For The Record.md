# For the Record

## Tracking my positions on matters important and otherwise.

## 1. Atheism. 

* There is insufficient evidence to support the claim that god(s) exist(s). I would technically be an agnostic, but that term would cover nearly everybody, or at the very least a segment of the population so large as to warrant further categorization. For all practical purposes, I am an atheist.
* The word 'atheist' makes me ambivalent. There is no necessity for a term to describe 'non-mathematician' or 'non-flat-earther.' That theism is a default position is interesting.

## 2. Identity.

* 'Tribalism' is often employed to disparage nationalism, patriotism, or different kinds of affection we show towards our in-group. The rationale presented is this: We should expand our group identity to include a wider range of people, even the entire population on earth. This is a guilt-stirring tactic; its purpose is to shame us so we don't oppose when we're taken advantage of.
* Do not miss out the fact that our---let's say---tribal proclivities are going nowhere, and for good evolutionary reasons.  Do not expect to compel people to give up their identity and associate with those far away physically and culturally, and simultaneously expect this arrangement to be stable. 
* Advocates of globalism who insist that nationalism is a threat should also recognize that globalism is unsustainable without nationalism. A group can expand in a stable way only if its subsets are stable. In this case, if a disturbance occurs, the group can backtrack to the next largest subset. A group that expands by disregarding the needs of its subsets, on the other hand, risk a more damaging disintegration if a disturbance of significance takes place.
